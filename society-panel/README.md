## ✨ Feature Overview

### One-Click Simulation Launch
Visually configure and launch agent society simulations with portable setup and execution.

### Global Command Console
Send commands and debug behaviors from a "God Mode" perspective to streamline strategy experiments.

### Event Stream Visualization
Aggregates real-time logs and key events to facilitate rapid troubleshooting of behavior and performance issues.

---

## 🖥️ Interface Introduction

The panel integrates three workspaces into a unified interface, supporting one-stop operations for building, uploading, and configuration.

### Dashboard

![Dashboard](assets/dashboard.png)

Centralizes simulation status display, quick controls, and real-time log streams.

- One-click execution of core operations like **Start / Stop / Regenerate Registry**
- God Mode Console debugging commands take effect in real-time
- Continuous scrolling of real-time event logs assists in tracking agent behavior

---

### File Management

![File Management](assets/file_management.png)

Uploads the MAS-Package and datasets required for simulation with one-click import.

- Supports upload and automatic extraction of plugin, config, and script packages
- Datasets are uniformly stored in `workspace/data` for version management
- Automatically generates `registry.py` after upload, eliminating manual resource imports

---

### Configuration Center

![Configuration](assets/configuration.png)

Enables visual editing of YAML configurations for convenient management.

- Left-side file navigation allows for quick configuration switching
- Form-based editing prevents syntax errors
- Auto-save functionality writes changes back to the corresponding file in `workspace/configs`

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

Follow the standard process from preparing assets to starting the simulation to ensure the success of your first experiment.

### Step 1: Prepare Your Simulation Assets

Package plugins, configs, and data into `MAS-Package.zip` and `Data.zip`.

```
MAS-Package.zip
├── plugins/
│   ├── action/
│   ├── agent/
│   └── environment/
├── configs/
│   ├── agents_config.yaml
│   ├── simulation_config.yaml
│   └── ...
├── custom_controller.py (optional)
├── custom_pod_manager.py (optional)
└── custom_folder/ (optional)

Data.zip
└── your_dataset/
    ├── agent/
    ├── map/
    ├── relation/
    └── ...
```

### Step 2: Upload Files

Upload the MAS-Package and Data on the **File Management** page and confirm successful recognition.

### Step 3: Verify Configuration

Add or modify configurations in the **Configuration Center** to ensure files meet requirements.

### Step 4: Start Simulation

Return to the **Dashboard**, click the **Start** button, and observe the status indicator and log output.

### Step 5: Interact & Observe

Send commands via the **God Mode Console** or monitor agent behaviors in the logs.

## ❓ FAQ

When encountering errors, check these scenarios first to quickly identify the root cause.

### What should I do if an error occurs after clicking Start?

Verify that the startup script output and config file match the current service address. Common causes include unready dependency containers or YAML path errors.

### Why can't I see the new plugin in the config page after upload?

Confirm the plugin inherits from the correct framework base class and that the MAS-Package upload succeeded. If necessary, manually execute **"Regenerate Registry"** in the Dashboard.

### What if the port is already in use?

Modify `FRONTEND_PORT` and `BACKEND_PORT` in `scripts/start_society_panel.sh` (or `.bat` for Windows), or adjust the port mapping in Docker Compose.

## 🛠️ Development

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 18+
- npm or pnpm

### Running Locally

From the project root directory:

```bash
# macOS / Linux
./scripts/start_society_panel.sh

# Windows
scripts\start_society_panel.bat
```

The script will automatically:
1. Create Python virtual environment and install dependencies
2. Install npm packages for the frontend
3. Start both backend (port 8001) and frontend (port 5174) services

Access the panel at: **http://localhost:5174**
